i. Swift programming language for IOS application

Servlet need to learn


JSON: java script object notation

XML : extended markup language

JSON; its leight weight process

difference between Web application and webservice

In case of webapplication, consumer must be a browser but in case of webservice consumer will be another application. as we know 

webservice is a way to communicate bewteen the two application over the network.

SOAP : Simple object access protocol
REST : Representational State Transfer.

Major differenc between the XML over JSON

XMl is heaivy weight format and ocuppied more space. its also required high level bandwidth to work with this format
thats why in mobile application used JSON format.

JSON is light weight format and ocuppied less space.

Need to download the jersy jar. to work for rest webservice. make google search "jersey rest api download"

most popular toll to test test REST webservice is psotman



Two implementation is used with the rest webservice one is jersey implementation developed by Sun and another one is by JBOSS implementation.


In jersey implemnttaion to invoke the rest webservice belwo servlet container need to configured in DD (web.xml)

Servlet Container: org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer

url pattern : should be /rs/*, rs indicate this is related to webservice request, because some time one single application support web application and 
 
web service both so just differenciate the url pattern

configured init-param attribute in web.xml

jersey packages config path: jersey.config.server.provider.packages
value for the customer package is : path for the package which contain the services : "azt.ws" custom package.


JAX - RS injection : means consumer will send some data to the provider and it will give responce back to client.

so sending data to the provider is called injection.

Different approches to send(inject) the data to the provider:

-@PathParam :In this injection we pass the data as /firstinput/secondinput and so on means, after the proper url
all inputs will be pass through the /(slash)
-@QueryParam : in this each input paramter will pass with the param_nam=param_value & seprator used between the two inputs
signature <url till webservice class>/<method_name>?<all inpputs which required for this method>

-@MatrixParam : in this ;(semi colon used after each input ) insted & and also after method name also.

-@FormParam : In this case we will create a html form and sumit the request to rs service
-@HeaderParam
-@BeanParam
-@CookieParam

in REST methods are called as resources and URL is called as URI

REST webservice worked on top of the http protocol.
